# Goal
This module is intended to assist a developer with identifying items reported
by other tools.

Some lofty ideas that may not be worth the effort (take this as a grain of sale)
* rector
** Generate a config
** Modify a config
** Dry-run using a config
** List the effective rules for a config (which is a rector built-in)
* composer
** validate (it's just running `composer validate`)
* grumphp
** run grumphp ad-hoc for a file, directory or list of files/directories

Things that I would like to have, but aren't necessary to start
* golem features
** Export/Import data
** capture/compare (it would be nice to be able to capture output from a run for
   later comparison with another)
